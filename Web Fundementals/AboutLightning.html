    <h2>What is lightning?</h2>
    
    <p>Lightning is a sudden electrostatic discharge that occurs typically during a thunderstorm. 
        This discharge occurs between electrically charged regions of a cloud (called intra-cloud lightning or IC),
         between two clouds (CC lightning), or between a cloud and the ground (CG lightning).</p>
