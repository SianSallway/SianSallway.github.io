            <br><p style="color:white;">This project is the result of an idividual assessment for a Cert III in Game Development, where we were required to create
            either a 2D or 3D game using software including Unity and Visual Studio. 'VOID' is a single player and retro inspired 2D action platformer. I liked the 
            idea of having the player explore and discover, whilst they move through an environment that has something new around every corner. The setting of 'VOID' 
            gives me the freedom to experiment and create unique environments and scenarios for entertaining gameplay. As I continue to study and learn I plan on continuing 
            development on 'VOID', and be publishing some of that journey here.</p><br>

            <h2>Idea constructing & planning</h2><br>
            
            <p style="color:white">Before diving into Unity and scripting, I began setting out my ideas in a game design document to outline
                the specifics of the project. Such specfications were listed in the original document as below;
            </p><br>

            <p style="color:white"><b>NOTE: Elements listed may not be included in the final version of 'VOID'.</b></p><br>
            
            <p style="color:white"><b><i>Plot/Context:</i></b></p>
            <p style="color:white">The player finds themselves stranded in an uncharted landscape known as "The Void". In an effort to find an exit 
            the player must encounter strange enemies and unfamiliar territory whilst they try to stay alive. What will they meet along the way?</p>

            <p style="color:white"><b><i>Core Gameplay:</i></b></p>
            <p style="color:white"><b>-</b>Platformer gameplay.</p>
            <p style="color:white"><b>-</b>Collecting items.</p>
            <p style="color:white"><b>-</b>Attacking enemies.</p>
            <p style="color:white"><b>-</b>Killing enemies.</p>
            <p style="color:white"><b>-</b>Moving objects.</p>
            <p style="color:white"><b>-</b>Gaining health.</p>
            <p style="color:white"><b>-</b>Losing health.</p>

            <p style="color:white"><b><i>Game Flow:</i></b></p>
            <p style="color:white">Player movement includes running left, right and jumping. The player will also be able to pick up collect objects
            and attack enemies. To complete a level, the player must reach a point at the end of the level map marked by an object (glowing etc.). The 
            player has failed the level when they die as a result of losing all of their health.</p><br>

            </div>
    

            <p style="color:white">With the setting being an unexplored fraction of space, the terrain can be as stark or as random as I want it 
            to be. I want to provide the player with unique environments to navigate and enhance the adventure aspect of the game. As the player 
            completes each level I would like to make the layouts more complicated and use the space in an efficient way.</p>

            For the asthetic of the game I wanted it to be reminiscent of classic arcade games. To achieve this I searched
            for assets that were in an 8bit style and Sci-fi themed. I came across a set of art assets on the Unity store by ANSIMUZ called 'Warped Caves',
            that was used to serve as the visual concept for 'VOID'.</p>
